### Contribution Policy
This is an open source project. 

**At this time, we are not accepting contributions.** 

If we accept contributions in the future, these can be made via pull requests as well as questions, feature requests, or bug reports via issues. Contact our team at [guide@llnl.gov](mailto:guide@llnl.gov) with any questions. Please also refer to our code of conduct.

I you aren't a project developer at LLNL, you won't have permission to push new branches to the repository. First, you should create a fork. This will create your copy of the repository and ensure you can push your changes up to GitHub and create PRs.

### Guidelines
- Review existing issues before opening a new one. Your issue might already be under development or discussed by others. Feel free to add to any outstanding issue/bug.
- Be explicit when opening issues and reporting bugs. What behavior are you expecting? What is your justification or use case for the new feature/enhancement? How can the bug be recreated? What are any environment variables to consider?
- Create your branches off the main branch.
- Clearly name your branches, commits, and PRs as this will help us manage queued work in a timely manner.
- Articulate your commit messages in the imperative (e.g., Add new privacy policy link to README).
- Commit your work in logically organized commits, and group commits together logically in a PR.
- Ensure any change is accompanied by additional unit tests if/as appropriate, and that all unit tests pass; see the README for instructions on running unit tests.
- Title each PR clearly and give it an unambiguous description.
